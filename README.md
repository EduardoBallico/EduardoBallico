# About me

I'm a **Software Engineer at Nelogica**, where I focus on creating and improving internal systems used daily by hundreds of people.  
Currently pursuing my **Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering at PUCRS**, I’ve spent the past years exploring both the technical and human sides of software — how good engineering, empathy, and collaboration come together to create real impact.

# Professional journey

Over the last four years, I’ve worked across different layers of the web stack — from crafting intuitive interfaces to designing solid backend structures.  
Most of my experience revolves around **TypeScript, Vue, PHP, and React**, but my real strength lies in **building efficient, scalable, and meaningful products**.

I believe good software is built through **clarity, empathy, and persistence** — and I’m constantly looking for better ways to connect technology with people’s needs.
