# Welcome to my Github Profile!

Hi there! My name is Eduardo Ballico, and here are some informations about me.

## About me

I've been working in web development for two years and I'm currently in the sixth semester of the Bachelor's degree program in Software Engineering at **PUCRS** - Brazil. 

Throughout my professional experience, I've engaged with various software development stacks, including user interface design, backend development, database management, and data processing for importation. The majority of my experience has been centered around working with PHP, JavaScript, Java, MySQL, React, and TypeScript.  

I'm currently working mostly with PHP and VueJS in the intranet area of **Nelogica**, a brazilian technology company that provides trading and investment solutions, market data and analytics, and educational resources for the brazilian financial market, with a focus on democratizing access to financial information.
